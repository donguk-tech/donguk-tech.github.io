# gmnx-viewer
Open-source viewer implementation supporting the MNX-Generic component of the
[MNX specification](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/index.html).

To view the examples, please visit [this page](https://joeberkovitz.github.io/gmnx-viewer/).

All SVG files in the viewer were exported directly from vector drawing applications without modification.

gmnx-viewer currently does not support:
- differentiation between synthesized instruments
- a concept of separate parts
- more than one page view of SVG per score
- view regions that are not based on existing element IDs in the SVG
- highlighting of graphical symbols that are not black-on-white
- automatic scrolling for visibility
